# ${1:Music Mixer}

We are tasked with the creation fo creating an interactive website that load audio clips to create a dynamic audio experience. Additionally, there will be a trigger animation and a compiled audio track, incredibox.com is an example of this. 

As a team, we have decided to create a website that offers meditation/ soothing audio, that can be personalized. We live in a high stress, busy environment with the rapid pace of technology, news and life. This website can offer meditators, a personalized experience when its comes to their audio choice. Wether its' yoga, mindfulness or studying to soothing sounds.
